# My_xmas_tree
A fun python program that prints out a Christmas tree

When run, program will ask "How tall is the tree" The answer will determine the length (in row) of the tree.

Program will also print out randomized 'O' characters that represent "lit" candles. The randomized amount will always be smaller than the amount of leaves "#"

Finally, the leg of the tree is dynamically created to be just a stem if user input "1" as the height of the tree
